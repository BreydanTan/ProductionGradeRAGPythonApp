I'll show you how to build an AI RAG application in Python and how to get it ready to deploy to production. I myself have made many AI projects on this channel, you've probably seen a few of them. And while those projects are super fun and cool and you can learn a lot, they're not ready to be deployed into the wild and used in a production environment. That's because they're missing observability, logging, retries, throttling rate, limiting all of the things that you need for a real production grade AI app.
